# > A common substring of a collection of strings is a substring of every member of the collection. We say that a common substring is a longest common substring if there does not exist a longer common substring. For example, "CG" is a common substring of "A**CG**TACGT" and "AAC**CG**TATA", but it is not as long as possible; in this case, "CGTA" is a longest common substring of "A**CGTA**CGT" and "AAC**CGTA**TA".
# >
# > Note that the longest common substring is not necessarily unique; for a simple example, "AA" and "CC" are both longest common substrings of "AACC" and "CCAA".
# >
# > **Given**: A collection of k (kâ‰¤100) DNA strings of length at most 1 kbp each in FASTA format.
# >
# > **Return**: A longest common substring of the collection. (If multiple solutions exist, you may return any single solution.)

# ## My interpretation/reasoning
# 
# 1. I am going to look for common substrings of DNA sequences in fasta format.  
#     From the example, it seems that 'common' means 'shared by _all_ sequences'!
# 
# 2. Of all the common substrings that exist, I only want to find the longest.
# 
# 3. If multiple substrings are the longest, I may return a random one. (Any correct answer is good.)
# 
# 4. There will be no more than 100 DNA sequences, with a length up to 1,000 bp.
# 
# Now practically, this means the code is to:
# 
#   - Open and read a fasta text file
#   - Take the first sequence
#   - In the second sequence, look for overlaps (>1) with the first and save all of them
#   - For each following sequence, compare to all overlapping sequences and overwrite when necessary (when the new overlap is shorter)
#   - In the end, find the longest remaining overlapping sequence. If multiple exist, pick the first.
#   
# The most difficult part will be in finding overaps/common substrings. 
# It looks like the `regex` library has nice functionality for that.
