# # Enumerating gene orders, from [Rosalind.info](https://www.rosalind.info)
# 
# (Specific exercise can be found at: http://rosalind.info/problems/perm/)
# 
# ## My personal interpretation of the problem
# 
# 1. You are given a numberm which is to be the length of the sequence ($n â‰¤ 7$)
# 
# 2. For this number, you take all the integers up to that number (e.g. $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7$).
# 
# 3. Then, you calculate or count the number of permutations you can make with length $n$,
# 
# 4. and finally, you print each of those permutations (on separate lines, the order does not matter).
# 
# To do that, I want my code to:
# 
# 1. read a number n between 1 and 7,
# 2. generate a list of numbers from 1 up to n,
# 3. calculate the number of permutations*,
# 4. create the list of permutations**,
# 5. and print the results.
# 
# \* : I happen to know the formula for this: permutations = (median or 'middle number' of 1 through n) * n  
# In this case that should be equal to: permutations = sum(all numbers 1 through n). E.g. for $n = 7$, that would make either $4 * 7 = 28$, or $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28$.
# 
# ** : creating this list will probably be the most challenging part of this exercise. I will try and take notes in my function(s) to explain how I do it.

#Now let's use the 'range' function to create a list of numbers:
for number in range(1,7+1):
    print(number)
#Remember to start from 1 (instead of 0), and end with n + 1,
# because the range is non-inclusive.

# # In-between thoughts...
# 
# Each permutation is built up as follows:
#  - for each and any number in the list,
#  - use that number as starting position as many times as there are other numbers
#  - then for the second position, use the next number as many times as there are numbers left.
#  - continue until no numbers are left.
#  
# Is that right?
# 
# So for instance with n = 3, you get:
# 
# 1. start with `1`, which leaves 2 and 3 (2 numbers)
# 2. that means 2 lines start with `1`
# 3. the next number in line is `2`, which leaves only 3 (1 number)
# 4. so there is one `1` followed by `2`
# 5. and that leaves only 3.
# 6. Now go to the second line and pick the second number next: `3`, which leaves 2.
# 7. Add this remaining 2 to the list.
# 
# You should now have:  
# `1 2 3`  
# `1 3 2`
# 
# Repeat the steps above for each other number in the list, i.e. `2` and `3` each get to be the starting number.
# 
# Now using this process will not directly generate the numbers in the required order, so they may have to be stored in lists and/or dictionaries before printing to the terminal.

# ## Second thoughts
# 
# I have been searching the web for an easier solution. Turns out there are ready-made functions for this. (Of course...)  
# Also see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/104420/how-to-generate-all-permutations-of-a-list
# 
# Probably the most useful functions are in the `itertools` library:
# ```python
# import itertools
# 
# list(itertools.permutations([1,2,3,4]))
# 
# ```
# 
# Now the only thing up to me is to print the combinations on separate lines, with spaces between the numbers.
