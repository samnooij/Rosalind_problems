    "> For a random variable $X$ taking integer values between 1 and $n$, the expected value of $X$ is\n",
    "> $E(X) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n}k×Pr(X=k)$.\n",
    "> The expected value offers us a way of taking the long-term average of a random variable over a large number of trials.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> As a motivating example, let $X$ be the number on a six-sided die.\n",
    "> Over a large number of rolls, we should expect to obtain an average of 3.5 on the die (even though it's not possible to roll a 3.5).\n",
    "> The formula for expected value confirms that\n",
    "> $E(X) = \\sum_{k=1}^{6}k×Pr(X=k)=3.5$.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> More generally, a random variable for which every one of a number of equally spaced outcomes has the same probability is called a uniform random variable (in the die example, this \"equal spacing\" is equal to 1).\n",
    "> We can generalize our die example to find that if $X$ is a uniform random variable with minimum possible value $a$ and maximum possible value $b$, then\n",
    "> $E(X) = \\frac{a+b}{2}$ \n",
    "> You may also wish to verify that for the dice example, if $Y$ is the random variable associated with the outcome of a second die roll, then\n",
    "> $E(X+Y)=7$.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Given**: Six nonnegative integers, each of which does not exceed 20,000.\n",
    "> The integers correspond to the number of couples in a population possessing each genotype pairing for a given factor.\n",
    "> In order, the six given integers represent the number of couples having the following genotypes:\n",

    "1. I am going to calculate an expected value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The calculation is a genetics exercise, involving allele frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The given numbers represent pairs of different genotypes: combinations of\n",
    "    - Homozygous dominant\n",
    "    - Homozygous recessive\n",
    "    - Heterozygous\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The answer should be the number of offspring with the dominant phenotype.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Offspring with a dominant phenotype should have at least one dominant allele.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Chances of getting a dominant allele differ per parent combination:\n",
    "    1. 1 (offspring always gets a dominant allele)\n",
    "    2. 1\n",
    "    3. 1\n",
    "    4. $0.5 + 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.75 (0.5 chance to get a dominant allele from parent 1, otherwise (other 0.5) it might get a dominant allele from parent 2 with a 0.5 chance)\n",
    "    5. 0.5 (it either gets the dominant allele from parent 1 or not)\n",
    "    6. 0 (no dominant alleles, no chance of getting one)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Note: these chances are per offspring, and each parent pair is expected to have _two_ offspring!**\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Now all these chances need to be connected to their respective positions for the script to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now practically, this means the code is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Open and read a text file with 6 space-separated positive integers or zero (0-20,000)\n",
    "  - These integers should be multiplied by their respective chance to produce offspring with a dominant allele (see point 6 above)\n",
    "  - Those numbers should be summed and returned as answer."
