    "\n",
    "1. The problem is about DNA palindromes (or possible restriction sites)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The input will be a DNA sequence of at most 1 kbp long\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What the program than needs to do is read the sequence from start do end,\n",
    "\n",
    "    - while checking for each substring of length 2-6 (the forward half of the potential 4-12 bp palindrome) if the next substring of equal length is its reverse complement\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. The output should then be 1) the position of this site, and 2) the length of the palindrome\n",
    "\n",
    "    - so not only keep the nucleotides, but keep the position and lengths (too)!\n",
