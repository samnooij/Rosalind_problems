    "> Recall the definition of the Fibonacci numbers from “Rabbits and Recurrence Relations”, which followed the recurrence relation Fn=Fn−1+Fn−2\n",
    "> and assumed that each pair of rabbits reaches maturity in one month and produces a single pair of offspring (one male, one female) each subsequent month.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Our aim is to somehow modify this recurrence relation to achieve a dynamic programming solution in the case that all rabbits die out after a fixed number of months. See Figure 4 for a depiction of a rabbit tree in which rabbits live for three months (meaning that they reproduce only twice before dying).\n",

    "1. The _input_ will be a number `n` (number of months the 'experiment' lasts), and a number `m` (number of months after which a rabbit dies).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You start with one pair of rabbits.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The rabbits mature after a month, produce offspring, live another month, producing offspring again, and then they die.\n",
    "  - Each rabbit pair can produce two pairs of offspring. \n",
    "  - Rabbits in this model have three (3) life stages: juvenile, adult 1 and adult 2. Both adult stages produce offspring. Adult 2 dies after doing so.\n",
    "  - Note that the number of life stages is equal to `m`!\n",
