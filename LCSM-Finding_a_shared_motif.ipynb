    "> A common substring of a collection of strings is a substring of every member of the collection. We say that a common substring is a longest common substring if there does not exist a longer common substring. For example, \"CG\" is a common substring of \"A**CG**TACGT\" and \"AAC**CG**TATA\", but it is not as long as possible; in this case, \"CGTA\" is a longest common substring of \"A**CGTA**CGT\" and \"AAC**CGTA**TA\".\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Note that the longest common substring is not necessarily unique; for a simple example, \"AA\" and \"CC\" are both longest common substrings of \"AACC\" and \"CCAA\".\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Given**: A collection of k (kâ‰¤100) DNA strings of length at most 1 kbp each in FASTA format.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Return**: A longest common substring of the collection. (If multiple solutions exist, you may return any single solution.)\n",

    "## My interpretation/reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I am going to look for common substrings of DNA sequences in fasta format.  \n",
    "    From the example, it seems that 'common' means 'shared by _all_ sequences'!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Of all the common substrings that exist, I only want to find the longest.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If multiple substrings are the longest, I may return a random one. (Any correct answer is good.)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. There will be no more than 100 DNA sequences, with a length up to 1,000 bp.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now practically, this means the code is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Open and read a fasta text file\n",
    "  - Take the first sequence\n",
    "  - In the second sequence, look for overlaps (>1) with the first and save all of them\n",
    "  - For each following sequence, compare to all overlapping sequences and overwrite when necessary (when the new overlap is shorter)\n",
    "  - In the end, find the longest remaining overlapping sequence. If multiple exist, pick the first.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The most difficult part will be in finding overaps/common substrings. \n",
    "It looks like the `regex` library has nice functionality for that.\n",
