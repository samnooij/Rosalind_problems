    "# Calculating protein mass, from [Rosalind.info](https://www.rosalind.info)\n",

    "(Specific exercise can be found at: http://rosalind.info/problems/prtm/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## My personal interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The exercise is about calculating the molecular weight of a protein\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The protein is represented as an amino acid sequence (a string of letters)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Molecular weights per amino acid are given in a table of monoisotopic masses\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The practical side of the exercise comes down to reading the table with masses and then translating the letters from a given sequence into numbers using the table and adding the numbers up.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think I can do this in three functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the monoisotopic mass table and convert to a dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Read the text file with the amino acid sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Take the amino acid sequence and mass table to calculate the mass"
