    ">A graph whose nodes have all been labeled can be represented by an adjacency list, in which each row of the list contains the two node labels corresponding to a unique edge.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">A directed graph (or digraph) is a graph containing directed edges, each of which has an orientation. That is, a directed edge is represented by an arrow instead of a line segment; the starting and ending nodes of an edge form its tail and head, respectively. The directed edge with tail v\n",
    "and head w is represented by (v,w) (but not by (w,v)). A directed loop is a directed edge of the form (v,v).\n",
    ">\n",
    ">For a collection of strings and a positive integer k, the overlap graph for the strings is a directed graph Ok in which each string is represented by a node, and string s is connected to string t with a directed edge when there is a length k suffix of s that matches a length k prefix of t, as long as s≠t; we demand s≠t to prevent directed loops in the overlap graph (although directed cycles may be present).\n",

    ">**Given**: A collection of DNA strings in FASTA format having total length at most 10 kbp.\n",

    "## My interpretation/reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I am expected to make a _directed_ graph of DNA sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Because it is directed, there is a clear order, e.g. the _end_ (suffix) of sequence 1 should match the _beginning_ (prefix) of sequence 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. From the example, it looks like you have to check: for each sequence, look which other sequences have a beginning that matches the end of the current sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The length of the overlap is defined as parameter _k_. In the example k = 3. (Is this also true for the actual exercise?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now practically, this means the code is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Open and read a fasta file\n",
    "  - For each sequence, take the name and suffix, then...\n",
    "  - match that suffix to each other sequence's prefix, and...\n",
    "  - if it matches, print the sequence name from the suffix and the matched prefix\n",
    "  - continue until no sequences are left."
