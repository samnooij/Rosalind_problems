# Rosalind_problems
Scripts and notebooks used to solve exercises from rosalind.info

---

This is a collection of scripts I have written to solve the bioinformatics exercises at [rosalind.info](http://rosalind.info).
They are written in Python, using Jupyter notebooks to mix my personal notes and comments with code.

I anticipate this will mostly be a record for myself, but feel free to copy any part that is of use!
